# Tableau DataAnalysis
I used a dataset from the NYPD website in this case.

Data was largely non-uniform.

R programming was used for data preprocessing and data cleaning.

Following that, data cleaning was used to remove outliers and superfluous features.

Created a Dashboard based on numerous Dataset properties, and then visualised and beautified it with multiple colour schemes.

Check out the pdf file for each steps performend and their detailed explaination.
