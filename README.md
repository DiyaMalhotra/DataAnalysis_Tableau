I leveraged a dataset obtained directly from the official website of the New York Police Department (NYPD) for the purpose of this data analysis.

The dataset exhibited a considerable degree of non-uniformity, necessitating the utilization of advanced data preprocessing and cleaning techniques using the R programming language.

Following the initial data preprocessing phase, a comprehensive data cleaning process was executed to identify and eliminate outliers and extraneous features that could potentially impact the accuracy and reliability of the analysis.

To provide a comprehensive and visually appealing representation of the dataset, a Dashboard was meticulously designed, incorporating various properties and characteristics of the dataset. The Dashboard was further enhanced through the application of multiple color schemes, resulting in aesthetically pleasing and informative visualizations.
